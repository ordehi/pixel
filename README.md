# Pixelattitude

> It's like your attitude on pixels or something.

Pixelattitude is a Pixel Art Editor built on plain web technologies, that is, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows creating pixel art in a predefined grid, saving and loading the art from localStorage, and exporting that art as a PNG.

## Goals and motivations

The main goal of this project is to learn more about different web APIs, as well as approaches we can use to build something like this.

Another important goal is to learn more about Open Source by implementing an OSS project of my own, hopefully working with other developers along the way to both learn from and help them learn.

It's also important to me to keep this constained to HTML, CSS, JS with as few third-party libraries as possible, ideally none. The reason being that I want to learn how to build these features without relying on too much third-party code (besides probably styles :D).

I also don't want to move this project to using something like Canvas ([probably taking hints from this](https://eloquentjavascript.net/19_paint.html)) or SVG even though I know it would likely make more sense to do so. I have plans to fork this once it's in a 'good enough' state, and rebuild it to use either of those technologies as its own project.

## Getting Started

Go to the 'Code' dropdown at the top and click on 'Download ZIP', unzip all files to the same directory and open index.html to start painting cells!

## Built With

- Just plain old HTML, CSS, JS, and a sprinkle of love for learning

## Acknowledgments

- The initial inspiration for this project came from The Odin Project's [Etch-a-Sketch project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project), and my usage of the awesome [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) software.
- Thanks to [Adam Argyle](https://github.com/argyleink) and all their [contributors](https://github.com/argyleink/open-props/graphs/contributors) for their work on [Open Props](https://github.com/argyleink/open-props), beautiful design system that's super easy to use. Saved me having to style this myself, for now.
